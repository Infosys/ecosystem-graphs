  name: CodeGen2
  # General
  organization: Salesforce
  description: >
    CodeGen2 is a family of auto regressive language models for program synthesis.
    Unlike the original CodeGen model family (i.e., CodeGen1), CodeGen2 is capable
    of infilling, and supports more programming languages.
  created_date:
    value: 2023-06-03
    explanation: >
      This model can be easily loaded using the AutoModelForCausalLM functionality.

      The intended uses are stated in the codegen2 model card:
      "The model is intended for and best at program synthesis, that is, generating
      executable code given English prompts, where the prompts should be in the form 
      of a comment string. The model can complete partially-generated code as well.".
