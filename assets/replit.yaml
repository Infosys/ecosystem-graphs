  description: >
      Replit-code-v1-3b is a 2.7B Causal Language Model focused on
      Code Completion. The model has been trained on a subset of the
      Stack Dedup v1.2 dataset. The model has been trained on the
      MosaicML platform with 256 x A100-40GB GPUs, leveraging their 
      latest LLM examples repo.replit-code-v1-3b is powered by 
      state-of-the-art LLM techniques, such as: Flash Attention for 
      fast training and inference, AliBi positional embeddings to 
      support variable context length at inference time, LionW optimizer, etc.
