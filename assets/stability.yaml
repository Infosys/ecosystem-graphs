  description: > 
    StableLM-Base-Alpha models are auto-regressive language models based on the NeoX transformer architecture. It is a suite of 3B and 7B parameter (coming in future: 15B, 30B, 65B and 175B) decoder-only language models pre-trained on a diverse collection of English and code datasets (built on top of The Pile dataset - https://pile.eleuther.ai/ - upto 1.5 trillion tokens) with a context length of 4096 tokens.
